![Walter](/uploads/walter "Walter") 

Walter is professor at the [Whiteplains Institute of Wizardry](http://spellboyorig.in/whiteplains-institute-of-wizardry). His knowledge of [the tomes](http://spellboyorig.in/the-tomes) and interaction with the [cloaked figures](http://spellboyorig.in/cloaked-figures) make him a useful source of information.
# Expedition to the Tabidi Valleys
Walter's research in the School of Aetheria at the the [Whiteplains Institute of Wizardry](http://spellboyorig.in/whiteplains-institute-of-wizardry) took him on an expedition to the [Tabidi Valleys](http://spellboyorig.in/the-tabidi-valleys). On this expedtion, Walter (along with his student [Darrell Burnshaw](http://spellboyorig.in/darrell-burnshaw)) discovered a [mysterious tome](http://spellboyorig.in/the-tomes) in an unknown language.

Shortly after discovering the tome, Walter and Darrell were attacked by [cloaked figures](http://spellboyorig.in/cloaked-figures), who used magical spells that seemed to warp space. Walter narrowly escaped with the tome through a portal to the Aetherial Plane. Darrell was killed.

# Meeting with the Crew
The Crew was referred to Walter after helping [Aldridge Sinclair](http://spellboyorig.in/aldridge-sinclair). A long time dealer of magical items, Aldridge knew Walter well.

After traveling to Whiteplains, the Crew met with Walter in his office. He explained what happened on his expedition with Darrell. After explaining what they had seen and found, the crew gave Walter their tome, hoping it may aid him in the translation of the mysterious langauge. Walter asked the crew to visit each of the sites on [the map](http://spellboyorig.in/ankheg-cave-map), as they may contain tomes of their own.
# Research
After receiving his second and third tome, Walter made progress in deciphering their language. He discovered that they contain spell from a forgotten school of magic that can warp space and time. He was able to use these spells to shrink a watermellon really small, which is pretty cool. His understanding of the language was incomplete, rendering the spells temporary and unstable.

<!-- TITLE: Sue Burnshaw -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A Simple Farmer -->
Sue was a farmer. She lived near [the ankheg cave](http://spellboyorig.in/the-ankheg-cave) with her husband [Quentin](http://spellboyorig.in/quentin-burnshaw). Both of them were killed by [cloaked figures](http://spellboyorig.in/cloaked-figures).
# Meeting the Crew
When four adventurers responded to her husband's job posting, he pitted them against each other in [a friendly fight](http://spellboyorig.in/session-1-introductions), not trusting in their abilities to carry out his request. Sue watched the fight and cooked a meal with [Sac](http://spellboyorig.in/saccharomyces-cerevisiae)
# Death
Sue died in her bed after writing about the day in her journal, which was stolen by her killer.

It is suspected that Sue was killed by the [cloaked figures](http://spellboyorig.in/cloaked-figures), due to nature of his injuries.
# Legacy
Sue's journal was found on the body of an [assassin](http://spellboyorig.in/cloaked-figures). She had written about Spellboy, possibly being the first to alert this shadowy organization to his whereabouts.

<!-- TITLE: Cloaked Figures -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A mysterious group hunting for Spell Boy -->

A group of men in black cloaks have been wreaking havoc across the continent. On at least on occassion, they were searching for [Spellboy](http://spellboyorig.in/spellboy).

# Characteristics
The cloaked figures practice a strange type of magic that warps space and time. This magic appears to be connected to the language found in Spellboy's notes and the tomes.
# Activities
[Quentin](http://spellboyorig.in/quentin-burnshaw) and [Sue](http://spellboyorig.in/sue-burnshaw) Burnshaw were found dead, with markings indicating that they had been killed by the cloaked figures' unique type of magic. Sue's journal (containing an entry describing her introduction to Spellboy) was stolen.

Before meeting the crew, [Daruka](http://spellboyorig.in/daruka) was tracking a small group of these men.  [After killing them](http://spellboyorig.in/session-4-the-magic-dealer), it was discovered that they carried a drawing of Spellboy.

[Walter](http://spellboyorig.in/walter) and [Darrell](http://spellboyorig.in/darrell-burnshaw) had an encounter with these men while researching the tomes. After finding a tome in the [Tabidi Valleys](http://spellboyorig.in/the-tabidi-valleys), they were attacked by a group of cloaked figures. Darrell was killed in the attack. Walter narrowly escaped through the Aethereal Plane.

The cloaked men visited [Brightfalls](http://spellboyorig.in/brightfalls) six months before the crew arrived. They were responsible for killing [King Rufus](http://spellboyorig.in/stewart), incapacitating the [city's guardian](http://spellboyorig.in/coatl), and stealing the  Brightfalls tome.

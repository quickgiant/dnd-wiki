<!-- TITLE: Darrell Burnshaw -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A traveling scholar -->

Darrell Burnshaw was a wizard. At [Whiteplains Institute of Wizardry](http://spellboyorig.in/whiteplains-institute-of-wizardry), Darrell studied in the School of Aetheria with [Walter](http://spellboyorig.in/walter).

He was the brother of [Quentin Burnshaw](http://spellboyorig.in/quentin-burnshaw).
# Research
Before he began his research with Walter, Darrell visited Brightfalls. While investigating the dungeon beneath the city, Darrell received a tome and map from the [Guardian of Brightfalls](http://spellboyorig.in/create/couatl). On his return to Whiteplains, Darrell showed the tome to Walter, who took an interest in its strange language.

Needing another tome to aid in the translation of the mysterious language, Darrell and Walter made their way to the [Tabidi Valleys](http://spellboyorig.in/the-tabidi-valleys), following a trail of strong magic. In a cave, they retrieved another tome. After retrieving the tome, the pair was attacked by [cloaked figures](http://spellboyorig.in/cloaked-figures).
# Death
Darrell was killed by [cloaked figures](http://spellboyorig.in/cloaked-figures) while retrieving the tome hidden in the [Tabidi Valleys](http://spellboyorig.in/the-tabidi-valleys) with [Walter](http://spellboyorig.in/walter).

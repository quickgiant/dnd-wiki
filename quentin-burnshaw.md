<!-- TITLE: Quentin Burnshaw -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A Simple Farmer -->

Quentin was a farmer. He lived near [the ankheg cave](http://spellboyorig.in/the-ankheg-cave) with his wife [Sue](http://spellboyorig.in/sue-burnshaw). Both of them were killed by [cloaked figures](http://spellboyorig.in/cloaked-figures).
# Family
Quentin was married to [Sue Burnshaw](http://spellboyorig.in/sue-burnshaw). Quentin's brother was [Darrell Burnshaw](http://spellboyorig.in/darrell-burnshaw).
# Quentin's Farm
Quentin had a small farm with a farmhouse, a barn, a blacksmith's workshop, and mill. Quentin's sheep were being eaten by the nearby ankhegs. While Quentin was a fighter, he was no longer confident enough in his abilities to take on the Ankheg.

Quentin was also a craftsman, building custom weapons and tools in his workshop.
# Meeting the Crew
Quentin posted a request for help on the nearby village's job board. When four adventurers responded, Quentin was sceptical of thier abilites. He pitted them against each other in [a friendly fight](http://spellboyorig.in/session-1-introductions), offering to make the winner a weapon.

Satisfied with their abilities, Quentin showed the crew where the akheg cave was, sending them off on their first adventure.
# Death
Quentin was killed while building the [Boy Baton](http://spellboyorig.in/the-boy-baton), a gift intended for Spellboy. He was killed by mysterious magic that left deep depressions in his body. His dead body attracted Hyenas to the farm.

It is suspected that Quentin was killed by the [cloaked figures](http://spellboyorig.in/cloaked-figures), due to nature of his injuries.
# Legacy
Quentin's last creation, the [Boy Baton](http://spellboyorig.in/the-boy-baton), is now used by [Danth](http://spellboyorig.in/danth-goldentoe).

Meeting with Quentin led the crew to [Darrell Burnshaw](http://spellboyorig.in/darrell-burnshaw), and in turn, the [Whiteplains Institute of Wizardry](http://spellboyorig.in/whiteplains-institute-of-wizardry).

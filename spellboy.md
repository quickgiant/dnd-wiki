Spellboy was a founding member of the crew. He left his drifter life behind, hoping that he would find answers. His light was extinguished before he could find closure.
# Early Life
![Digging For Scraps](/uploads/digging-for-scraps.png "Digging For Scraps"){.align-center}
Spellboy awoke in the ruins of tower surrounded by strange notes. He couldn't remember anything -- not even his own name. He made a life for himself digging in the city's scrap piles, finding just enough to survive. In time, he found that he had a natural ability with magic and named himself Spellboy.

Knowing he was unusual, Spellboy embarked on a quest to find out who he was and why he had these abilities.
# Joining the Crew
Spellboy met the crew after responding to a job posting from [Quentin Burnshaw](http://spellboyorig.in/quentin-burnshaw). Suspecting that the group that showed up would not be up to the task, Quentin hosted a [competition between the respondents](http://spellboyorig.in/session-1-introductions). Intimidated by the other fighters, Spellboy slipped away and hid in a mill tower. When all but one contestant remained, Spellboy unleased his magical abilities, winning the competition.

The battle led the crew to begrudgingly respect Spellboy, even though he was still really weird. The spirited fighting also led to Quentin to promise a gift to Spellboy: [the Boy Baton](http://spellboyorig.in/the-boy-baton).
# Death
After proving their worth, Spellboy and the crew went on to [kill the ankhegs](http://spellboyorig.in/session-2-the-ankhegs) that had been terrorizing Quentin's farm. While the ankheg queen was killed without incident, her hatchlings proved a difficult fight. In an attempt to block their entry, Spellboy stepped to close the action. A hatching spit acid directly onto his body. He melted.

After dispatching the ankheg hatchlings, the newly formed to crew attempted to revive Spellboy, but it was too late. [Danth](http://spellboyorig.in/danth-goldentoe) picked up Spellboy's notes, hoping to uncover the answers Spellboy never found.

The discovery of [a mysterious map](http://spellboyorig.in/create/ankheg-cave-map) made the mystery deeper. It contained similar symbols to one's in Spellboy's notes.
# Legacy
Sinister [cloaked figures](http://spellboyorig.in/cloaked-figures) have been seen throughout the land. In at least one instance, they carried a drawing of Spellboy.

The mysterious language in Spellboy's notes is the same as the one found in [the tomes](http://spellboyorig.in/the-tomes). This language appears to be tied to magic that warps space itself.

Spellboy's general backstory is known the players. 

There was once powerful wizard. As he grew old, he began to fear death. He sought eternal life so he could continue his studies and grow more powerful. He spent his final years developing a spell that would make him young again. He grew greedy however, and tried to cast the spell on himself too early. The result was Spellboy. He went back too far -- a boy, not a young man -- and he lost the very knowledge he was trying to protect.
